### A project attempting to provide an interface to posts of voat.co/v/music.

## Purpose

## Initial strategy / requirements

- First order of business will be to scrape voat
- After that, set up the ability to display youtube videos embedded in the frame (you can play and pause that way)

- I'll use bootstrap css for the basic layout
